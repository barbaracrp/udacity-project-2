# Landing Page

## Description

This project was bootstrapped from the Udacity template,
that had the educational purpose to change from a static, to a interactive landing page.
You can see the page by opening index.html in your browser.

- I added a `addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded')`

- I added 2 functions:

1. to create menu bar. `buildMenu()`
In it was used the following skills learned in the **The DOM** classes.

- `for each`
- `querySelectorAll`
- `getElementById`

  1. navigation change by scroll and click `activeItem()`
In it was used the following skills learned in the **Working with Browser Events** classes.
- `addEventListener`
- `classList.add` and `classList.remove`

- I added Section 4 in the HTML

- I added smooth scroll and navigation change by scroll using:
  1. `getBoundingClientRect()`
  2. `innerHeight`
